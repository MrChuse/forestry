Forestry is a little game about selective breeding!
You are going to be a professional bee breeder and your goal for now is to build an alveary.
In order to do this you'll have to (surprisingly) breed the bees you have and try to find the pairs of species that result in a mutation after mating.

## Installation
### Windows
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-pygame.txt
python gui.py
```
### Linux (not tested but should work, it's python)
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-pygame.txt
python gui.py
```
