Welcome to a demo of my little game about selective breeding!
You are going to be a professional bee breeder
  and your goal for this demo is to build an alveary.
In order to do this you'll have to (surprisingly) breed
  the bees you have and try to find the pairs of species that
  result in a mutation after mating.
When you are ready, type `help next` into the console and hit
  `Enter` in order to proceed.
===
So, as you might have guessed, this game is in its
  early stage of development so the way you interact with
  it is via this console on the bottom. There are a lot of commands
  and we are going to introduce them using pages of this helper manual.
You have already discovered your first command: `help`, it will be
  your guide throughout this journey. Almost all commands in this game
  have parameters which describe the action you want to take.
Example: `help` command can take zero or one parameter in a form
  of a string. `help` without any arguments will show you the list
  of all the existing command but I suggest you not to look at it yet
  as it might scare you :)
  `help next` and `help prev` will show next and previous
  pages of this manual respectively, `help close` will close this manual,
  `help manual` will open it back and most importantly
  `help <command>` will show you the help on the <command> you provided.
===
Well, it's finally time to play.
You start with 0 bees, so you need a way to collect them
  in the first place. `forage` will help you.
Also, you may change the order of things shown to you
  with `show` and `unshow` commands.
  You may also use `inv` and `apiary 0` commands to show only them
Go ahead and type `help close` and `forage` and look at what you'll
  have ended up with. When you need more commands, get back here using
  `help manual` command!
===
Now you have bees, so you need a way to manipulate them.
Try out `put`, `swap`, `throw`, `take` commands.
If you need any help, use `help <command>`.
===
When you've colected some resources, you can `inspect` your bees.
It will show their genotype which is much more informative than 
  the phenotype which you see with your bare eyes.
Also, try out `build` command, it's actually the way you win this
  game. The `build alveary` is probably not available for you yet
  as you have not collected more advanced bees yet. Probably.
===
I think you have gathered enough knowledge to play on your own, so
  I wish you good luck on your bee-breeding journey.
You might want to take a closer look at `save`, `load` and `exit`
  commands so you don't lose progress.
